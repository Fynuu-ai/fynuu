                  Welcome to Fynuu. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Fynuu mobile app and any related services. Fynuu is a personal assistant app (hybrid on-device and cloud-based LLM) providing features like reminders, planning, a floating overlay window, and storing your preferences. By downloading, installing, or using Fynuu, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please do not use the app.

                  <li><strong>Limited License:</strong> Fynuu grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install, and use the app strictly according to these Terms. You may use Fynuu for your personal purposes.</li>
                  <li><strong>Account and Authentication:</strong> Fynuu may require you to sign in with a Google account (using Firebase Authentication). You are responsible for keeping your account credentials secure and for all activity under your account.</li>
                  <li><strong>No Resale or Distribution:</strong> You agree not to license, sell, rent, lease, assign, distribute, transmit, or otherwise commercially exploit the app or its content. You may not modify, create derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, decrypt, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the app or its code.</li>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">Permissions and Device Access</h2>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                  Fynuu requires certain device permissions to provide its features. By granting these permissions, you enable the corresponding functionality:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> For voice input to the AI assistant. (Permission must be granted in your device settings.)</li>
                  <li><strong>Location:</strong> To offer location-based reminders and planning features.</li>
                  <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send you reminder and alert notifications.</li>
                  <li><strong>Display Over Other Apps:</strong> To show the floating assistant window atop other apps.</li>
                  <li><strong>Alarms:</strong> To schedule and trigger reminders at the correct time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  You acknowledge that if you deny some permissions, related features may be unavailable. The app will request these permissions when needed. You may change your permissions in your device settings.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">Data Storage and Privacy</h2>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                  Fynuu is designed with user privacy in mind:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>On-Device Storage:</strong> All personal data, preferences, and entries (e.g. reminders, voice inputs) are stored locally on your device using encrypted storage (e.g. RoomDB). No personal data is stored unencrypted on external servers.</li>
                  <li><strong>Use of Cloud Services:</strong> When you use cloud-based AI services (for example, to process voice input or queries), any data sent from your device is encrypted in transit. We strip or anonymize personal identifiers so that cloud servers only receive the content needed to generate a response.</li>
                  <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Fynuu uses Firebase services (Authentication, Analytics, Crashlytics, etc.) and Google APIs under their own terms. These services may collect non-personal analytics data to help improve the app. We do not sell or rent your personal data.</li>
                </ul>
